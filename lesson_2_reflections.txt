What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git directory and uses it to start
tracking changes. We need to do this in order to
use the version control features of git.


How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you
think it offers?

While the working directory stores the files, the
staging area stores only the files that are going
to be commited. It allows you to be selective when
choosing which files to commimt.
