When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

If you plan on using multiple computers to work on a
project or if you will have multiple people working
on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatially stay-up-to-date
with your remote repository?

If you're in the middle of adding changes to a project
the addition of someone elses changes might negatively
impact your work.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and
branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copies of another persons remote that link
back to the original remote, but allow the user to
make changes to their own version of the master
without affecting the original remote. Clones are just
complete copies of repositories, and can be used to
push and pull changes to and from a remote. Branches
are different parts of one repository that allow you
to create alternate versions of the code to test new
features or fix bugs without affecting the main code.
