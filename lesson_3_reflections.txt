When would you want to use a remote repository rather
than keeping all your work local?

If you plan on using multiple computers to work on a
project or if you will have multiple people working
on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatially stay-up-to-date
with your remote repository?

If you're in the middle of adding changes to a project
the addition of someone elses changes might negatively
impact your work.
